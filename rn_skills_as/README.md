# Da Vinci Skills Action Server

## INTRODUCTION

This action server contains all the Skills that are currently available. You can either use a ROS action client as an interface to request actions through a ROS action server, which manages all the skills behind the scene, or you can instantiate the skill objects into your own code so you can use the internal interfaces directly in your code.
